# M-Pesa Button Integration

This project demonstrates a simple web-based M-Pesa payment integration using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Safaricom Daraja API. The system allows users to:

- Click a button labeled **"Now Make Payment"**
- Enter an amount in Kenyan Shillings (KES)
- Initiate an STK Push request to their M-Pesa mobile number
- Complete the payment by entering their M-Pesa PIN on their phone

## üîß Requirements

- XAMPP or any local server (e.g., Laravel Valet)
- Safaricom Daraja API credentials
- [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) (to expose your localhost for testing callbacks)

https://your-ngrok-url.io/callback.php
üì≤ How It Works
When the user clicks "Now Make Payment", they are prompted to enter an amount.

The form sends the amount and phone number to stkpush.php.

The script sends a real-time STK Push to the user via Safaricom Daraja API.

The user enters their M-Pesa PIN to complete the transaction.

Safaricom calls your callback.php to confirm the transaction status.

üîê Security Notes
Keep your consumer key and consumer secret safe.

Never expose your M-Pesa credentials in frontend files.

Ensure you use HTTPS (Ngrok or production server) for live payments.
